To work with the local database SQLite, [ORM ROOM](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) is used together with [ksp](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room).
[The Prepopulate your Room database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/prepopulate) is used in the project for convenient testing.
